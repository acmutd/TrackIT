## Admin
To use the admin dashboard, first login using your admin credentials. It should be noted that to login to an admin account, you must go to /admin. If your account is registered and you have admin access, you will be directed to the dashboard. Here you can see a view of all workshops. 

Here, you will see a list of all workshops, their titles, dates, and a progress bar. This progress bar will change as a workshop progresses. Here the green represents the percentage of students who are on the same workshop level as the admin, the yellow, is the percentage of students behind the workshop admin, and the red is the number of workshop levels left. 

Expanding workshop provides full details of it. From here, you can start the workshop, edit the workshop, delete workshops, create new workshops, and see the progress of students in any workshop. Underneath, you will also find a graph showing the number of students at each level as well as the progress of every individual student in the workshop. Furthermore, you will be able to see the workshop resources and the ability to download the student workshop data in CSV format. 

## User

The user will be taken to a login page. When they enter valid account credentials, they will be redirected to a page where they can enter the workshop ID of the workshop they want to join. If this is valid, they are taken to the workshop. 

On the workshop page, they will first see a welcome page. Upon going past that, they will officialy begin the workshop. A user will only be able to go as far the admin has enabled. Upon completing a level, they will click mark Complete which will allow them to move the next stage if the admin has allowed it. If not, they will wait until the admin allows it and the next button appears. They can navigate through the current page and previous pages using the 'next' and 'previous' buttons. At the top, you will see a progress bar. The green is how far through the workshop you have comeplted. The yellow is how many levels you are behind the admin, and the red is how many levels are left.
